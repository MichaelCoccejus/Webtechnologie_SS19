        <h2>The Cat</h2>
        <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the
            family
            Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.[4]
            The
            cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact.[5]
            A
            house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds
            are
            recognized by various cat registries.[6]</p>
